Welcome to the How-to-Write-Memory-Efficient-Java-Code wiki!


Garbage collection has largely removed the need to think about memory management when you write Java code, but there is still a benefit to understanding and minimizing the memory usage of your applications, particularly with the growing number of deployments of Java on embedded devices. This session gives you insight into the memory used as you write Java code and provides you with guidance on steps you can take to minimize your memory usage and write more-memory-efficient code. It shows you how to

&bull; Understand the memory usage of Java code

&bull; Minimize the creation of new Java objects

&bull; Use the right Java collections in your application

&bull; Identify inefficiencies in your code and remove them
